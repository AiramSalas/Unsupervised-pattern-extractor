## Overview
This project analyses vertical profiles of atmospheric turbulence using unsupervised deep learning techniques. Hourly heatmaps are generated from turbulence measurements across altitude levels and then transformed into multi-channel tensors to serve as input for models like CNN-EfficientNetB1 in this case, but instead of classification, the CNN is used as feature extractor of useful info for clustering.

## Features
| Feature                     | Description                                                                               |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üå™ Profile Processing       | Converts turbulence profiles into hourly heatmaps.                                        |
| üß© Feature extractor        | Use CNN layers BUT as feature extractor from generated heatmaps                           |
| üß† Temporal Deep Learning   | Uses models such as EfficientNetB1+advprop weights to learn time-dependent patterns.      |
| üåà Multi-Channel Tensors    | Includes seasonality day-of-year encoded as sine/cosine channels.                         |         
| üîç Unsupervised Clustering  | Extracts features and clusters patterns without labeled data.                             |

## Screenshots
